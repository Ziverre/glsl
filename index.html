    <h1>Shader Art</h1>
    <p>Shaders are programs that live on the GPU and used mainly in graphics to either render things or manipulate images.</p>
    <p>Although there are multiple types of shaders (e.g Vertex, Geometry etc), the focus of this page is the Fragment shader, which computes the color values of a pixel.</p>
    <div class="hint-box"><i>Dev note: The nature of GPU rendering opens up to being able to use mathematics in order to create relatively complex images faster than when it is done using software rendering, although it comes with its own challenges as well.</i></div>
    </div>
    <p>The goal is to showcase my shader artworks with explanation of how they are implemented.</p>
